### Description

A sample that takes advantage of the media capture functionality in the browser.

In the latest Windows 10 preview release, Microsoft added support for media capture APIs in our Edge browser for the first time. This feature is based on the Media Capture and Streams specification, developed jointly at the W3C by the Web Real-Time Communications Working Group and the Device APIs Working Group. Some developers may know it simply as getUserMedia, which is the main interface that allows webpages to access media capture devices such as webcams and microphones.
